  When everything is ready, you can play the game!
  However, since this project is a prototype, it will freeze when game over.
  I'm really sorry, but in that case, please force quit the game

Game Play Guide
  1. This game is an obstacle dodging game for 2 players.
  2. Obstacles are divided into two types, black and white.
     Even if the same color matches, it will not die. However, if different colors collide, the game is over and the winner is displayed.
